## Usage
Our app is designed to run smoothly on any Android device running Android 8 or later. The primary feature of the app is the SOS button, which, when triggered, sends a distress message to the victim's trusted contacts. This is done through the use of SMS messages, which are sent to the designated contacts immediately after the SOS button is pressed. The SMS message contains a custom message that the user can personalize to their liking, which will include a request for help as well as a link to the current location of the victim. This feature can be especially useful in emergencies where the user may not be able to provide detailed information on their location, or may be unable to speak.
